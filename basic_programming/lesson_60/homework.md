**Задача 1**

Create an application-game “TarakansRace”
Tarakan - thread running loop of distance iterations.  At each iteration the thread prints out its own number and sleeps a random amount of milliseconds [2-5]  The sleeping time range should be the same for all tarakans.
Tarakan that is finishing the loop the first is the winner.   <br/>

The application should take a number of tarakans and a distance from the console input/output.    <br/>

At the end of a game there should be printed out the following message
“Congratulations to tarakan #X (winner)” where X - is the tarakan-winner number  <br/>
